Geometry Processing Frameworks

In this repository, you can find different kinds of Frameworks that I created for geometric processing algorithms. Especially focusing on the visualization of meshes, and optimization algorithms. 
This repository is just a wrap of different libraries and some added functionalities.  

## Installation

### Conda 
Install [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/download.html) in your computer 

### Install environment

Go to the repository folder and you will find the file environment.yml. Go to the terminal and install the environment

''' conda env create -f enviroment.yml '''

### Running notebook

In the repository folder you will find hJupyter. The main notebook is **hananJup.ipynb** but you can create another notebook for your purposes. 

The **geometry** folder contains files related to the half-edge data structure to handle mesh connectivities and **testFolder** where it is tested some of the new functionalities. 

The **optimization** folder holds all related to linear solvers and optimizers. So far it has been implemented Levenberg-Marquart algorithm and Projected Guided is meant to be implemented soon.
