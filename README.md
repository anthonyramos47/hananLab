Geometry Processing Frameworks

In this repository, you can find different kinds of Frameworks that I created for geometric processing algorithms. Especially focusing on the visualization of meshes, and optimization algorithms. 
This repository is just a wrap of different libraries and some added functionalities.  

*The name Hanan comes from the Kichwa cosmovision where Hanan-Pacha refers to the spiritual world*
